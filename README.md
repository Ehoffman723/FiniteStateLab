# FiniteStateLab

## Project Overview
In this project I inplemented a choose your own adventure game using Twine. The adventure
is based around a DnD adventure involving where your goal is to defeat a dragon to save a
village.

The adventure is made using Twine which uses html as the base language. When started it will
bring the user to a page that will allow them to choose their options that follow the story.

The run the project the user will click on the index.html in the github. This will open a seperate
html page that will start their adventure.

This project was a good way to visualize how state machines work and process. Each arrow shows a state
change and each node idetifies a state. Im pretty happy with the story that I was able to make as DnD
is a fun hobby of mine. I was also able to connect each of the nodes/states effectively to convey the
story. I would love to be able to do this all in html myself without the help of twine.
